# Task Tracker Project 🚀

A simple and interactive task management app built using React. It allows users to:
- Add tasks with a title, description, due date, and status.
- Edit tasks inline.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks persistently using `localStorage`.

## 🛠 Features
- **Add Task**: Add new tasks with details.
- **Edit Task**: Inline editing functionality for seamless updates.
- **Delete Task**: Remove unwanted tasks from the list.
- **Status Management**: Track tasks with `Pending`, `In Progress`, and `Completed` statuses.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved locally for continuity.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
